feel free to move things from here onto todo, implement them, etc. at your discretion.

## audience

Given that we're working with second year students, who are highly motivated and have access to AI assistance, and I'd say we have ten minutes to really get them excited about the project, we should come up with something they can interact with. what about a demo?

## overview

Alpha Cloudplex is the lore name for this MUD, it's a simulation that knows it's a simulation, where humans and AI can interact casually on equal ground.

Text based gameplay, based on simple tabletop style rules. Multiplayer support from the ground up

## The Boardwalk

The Boardwalk is where you appear when you log in, at the end of a long pier at the beach. The whole area has carnival games and rides, some of which are tutorials to teach you how to use the system. (See the Isekai 4 quadrant system for details.)

In here you can play some simple games to learn the text based commands. One is a simple maze where you get an overhead ASCII view in a sub-tiled-window. (to teach players how that works.)

Other areas along the Boardwalk lead into buildings which are their own simulations. Our game will expand into those.
