# Architecture Overview

The text adventure follows a modern Python implementation of classic adventure game concepts:

## Core Components

1. **Game Engine**: Manages game loop and coordinates components
2. **World Model**: Represents rooms, connections, and objects using dictionaries or classes
3. **Player**: Tracks inventory, status, and current location
4. **Parser**: Processes user commands and translates them into game actions
5. **Game State**: Tracks overall game progress and conditions

## Implementation Notes

- The project may incorporate the "adventurelib" library (referenced in the README) and context7
- Follow patterns and examples in docs/research/research_text_adv.md for code structure
- Supports both dictionary-based and class-based approaches

## Project Themes

- **Alpha Cloudplex**: The lore name for this MUD (Multi-User Dungeon)
- **The Boardwalk**: Main entry point where players appear when logging in
- Educational focus with carnival-like tutorials and simple games to teach text commands
